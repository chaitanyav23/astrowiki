#### Standard Model

## Overview
<br />

The [Standard Model](#standard-model) of particle physics is the theory describing three of the four known fundamental forces (electromagnetic, weak and strong interactions â€“ excluding gravity) in the universe and classifying all known elementary particles. 


Most of us have heard the term electron, photon, neutrino, boson (especially higgs boson) but do not know much about other terms like charm, strange, gluon etc. Before moving further you should know that all the elementary particles can be broadly classified into two categories - Fermions, and Bosons. A Hadron is a composite subatomic particle. Every hadron must fall into one of the two fundamental classes of particle, bosons and fermions.
